## Introduction

As per the requirements outlined in the task for the technical round for **VIT-B MUN Club**, this website has been developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) library. Frameworks like Bootstrap were intentionally not used to showcase my frontend development skills.

The design and features of this website are inspired by the [VIT-B MUN website](https://vitbmun.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **User-Friendly Responsive Interface:** Ensures seamless navigation across all devices.
- **Glass-morphic navbar:** Designed specifically for mobile and tablet users to enhance visual appeal.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** Supports all screen sizes and types for optimal user experience.
- **Framework-Free Animations:** Created using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate pure development skills.
- **Interactive Hover Effects:** Enhanced hover effects on the navbar, buttons, and social media icons to provide a more engaging user experience.
